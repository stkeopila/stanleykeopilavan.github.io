                Hi! My name is Stanley where I was born and raised in <strong>San Francisco</strong>. I am currently a second year computer science major 
                and some of my hobbies are video games, sports, gym, and impulse shopping!
                </p>
                <p>
                This year I hope to make an impact on my community and want to pursue my dream of creating projects that can be useful to people.
                </p>
